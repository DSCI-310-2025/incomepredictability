Description: The incomepredictability package helps you to carry out a Logistic Regression based on the U.S. Adult Income dataset. There are 4 functions available to utilize:
    1. `download_data()`: This function allows you to download a dataset from a URL and save it locally.
    2. `train_test_split()`: This function allows you to split a data frame into training and testing subsets.
    3. `train_logistic_model()`: This function trains a logistic regression model for binary classification.
    4. `compute_model_metrics()`: This function computes evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, cohen's kappa from a confusion matrix.
